Earthquake data is continually collected and published by the Instituto Geográphico Nacional (IGN). ...\n\n## Introduction\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code .hidden}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\neruptions = [1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021]\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code .hidden}\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 1))\nplt.eventplot(eruptions, lineoffsets=0, linelengths=0.1, color='black')\nplt.gca().axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\nplt.ylabel('')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](index_files/figure-docx/fig-timeline-output-1.png){#fig-timeline fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code .hidden}\navg_years_between_eruptions = np.mean(np.diff(eruptions[:-1]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .hidden execution_count=6}\n```\nnp.float64(79.83333333333333)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{#a3d4d8eb .cell .markdown}\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average. Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as [@albertus2021], have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth). Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline). Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods. Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                | Year |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Current             | 2021 |\n| Teneguía            | 1971 |\n| Nambroque           | 1949 |\n| El Charco           | 1712 |\n| Volcán San Antonio  | 1677 |\n| Volcán San Martin   | 1646 |\n| Tajuya near El Paso | 1585 |\n| Montaña Quemada     | 1492 |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/data-screening.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Results and Discussion {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
